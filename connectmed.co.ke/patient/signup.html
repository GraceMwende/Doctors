<p>12.9 ConnectMed is required to comply with Kenyan health care privacy and security laws and maintain safeguards to protect the security of your health information. The information you provide to your healthcare professional during a medical consultation or therapy session is legally confidential, except for certain legal exceptions. We devote considerable effort toward ensuring that your personal information is secure. Below is an explanation of the manner in which we process and use your personal information: Our Services are deployed via the Heroku Platform and more information on its best practice security policies, which include firewalls and encryption, can be found here: https://www.heroku.com/policy/security. Additionally, we utilize cookies to provide you with the best Website experience; notably, if you lose network connectivity or close your browser momentarily while logged into our Services, you won’t lose your current session when you re-access the Website. Further, we employ reasonable physical, electronic and managerial security methods to help protect against unauthorized access to Personal Information, such as encryption. But please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet or data storage facility can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>12.10 In order to access certain features of our Website, we may ask you to provide certain demographic information including your gender, year of birth, address, and payment information. You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the website’s registration form. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the website (or any portion thereof). In addition, neither ConnectMed nor our healthcare professionals will be liable for any loss, injury or harm associated with your provision of false or inaccurate information. Our use of any information you provide to us as part of the registration process is governed by the terms herein.</p>
<p>12.11 In order to use certain features of our Site, you may need a username and password, which you will receive and/or create through the Site's registration process. We reserve the right to reject or terminate the use of any username that we deem in our sole judgment offensive or inappropriate. In addition, we also reserve the right to terminate the use of any username or account, or to deny access to the Site or any features of the Site, to anyone who violates these Terms and Conditions or who, in our sole judgment, interferes with the ability of others to enjoy our website or infringes the rights of others. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and you are responsible for all activities (whether by you or by others) that occur under your password or account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your password or account information.</p>
<p>12.12 ConnectMed shall not be responsible in any manner for the authenticity of the personal information or sensitive personal data or information supplied by the User to ConnectMed or to any other person acting on behalf of ConnectMed.</p>
<p>12.13 The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the User’s account access information and password, if the User is registered on the Website.

<p>12.16 Information We Collect via Technology </p>
As you use the Site or the Service, certain information may be passively collected by Cookies, navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and third party tracking services, including:
a. Site Activity Information. We may keep track of some of the actions you take on the Site, such as the content of searches you perform on the Site.
b. Access Device and Browser Information. When you access the Site from a computer or other device, we may collect anonymous information from that device, such as your Internet protocol address, browser type, connection speed and access times (collectively, "Anonymous Information").
c. Cookies. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies to make the Site and Service easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and ConnectMed. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept Cookies, however, you will not be able to stay logged in to the Site. We presently do not honor "Do Not Track" requests across all part of our Site.
d. Real-Time Location. Certain features of the Site use GPS technology to collect real-time information about the location of your device so that the Site can connect you to a health care provider who is licensed or authorized to provide services in the place where you are located.
e. Mobile Services. We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device or computer. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include how you use the application(s) and information about the type of device or computer you use. In addition, in the event our application(s) crashes on your mobile device we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our application(s).
f. Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives and we may also retain Anonymous Information about your use of our Service. Once we disclose some of your Personal Information to third parties, we may not be able to access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures. After we delete Personal Information, we will retain De-Identified Data and will continue to use De-Identified Data as permitted under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>12.20 We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time in the future. We will post any revised version of the Privacy Policy on this page. Continued use of our Service following notice of such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
